# Wearable-Development-Board-Sadda-Hack-2020

Most of us who are into making hardware projects for competitive purposes or as a hobby will be familiar with open source developmental boards such raspberry pi, Arduino etc., They are available as open source boards for us to build our own projects using them. But we found a shortcoming of these boards which was that there was no prominent development board which could be used to develop wearables projects. So we have taken up the task to build a developmental board which can be used as a base for building various kinds of smart wearable devices. Our board will be based on ESP8266-12E SOC. It will be having an OLED display, push buttons and a charging circuit. We will be demonstrating the versatility of our board by developing a minimum of two projects using it for different use cases.
